# Build Tesseract

Instructions to build tesseract from source.

This repository contains information about how to build [Tesseract ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) for different platforms from source. I needed Tesseract for my C# project, but wasn't able to find any good package for ocr that would run on Android. I haven't build C/C++ projects from source before, so I had some difficulties. When I finally found working instructions I gathered them here with some of my own thinking and fixing problems, like missing dependency. I also wrote a little script that can automatically build for Android. I hope this helps someone! I am still beginner with these build tools, so if there are any mistakes let me know!

Currently instructions for
